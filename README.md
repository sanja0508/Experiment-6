#Experiment 6
AIM: The aim of these C++ programs is to develop an understanding of fundamental programming constructs by creating simple pattern-based outputs and logic-based operations using loops, conditionals, and character handling.

APPLICATION USED : VS Code

THEORY: C++ is a general-purpose programming language that supports structured and object-oriented programming. It is widely used for system/application software and game development. In these programs, we explore basic concepts such as output formatting, loop control structures (for loops), and condition checking using if statements. Each code snippet demonstrates a different logical structureâ€”from printing characters and patterns to identifying even numbers within a range.

Pattern printing often uses nested loops, where an outer loop controls the number of rows, and the inner loop controls the columns or content in each row. Spacing and character sequencing are handled using counters and incremental logic.

PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS USED:

Input/Output Streams: Using cout for displaying output

Loops: for loops are used extensively for iteration

Nested Loops: For managing rows and columns in patterns

Conditionals: if conditions help in filtering even numbers

Character Manipulation: Incrementing characters (like 'A'++) to print alphabet sequences

ALGORITHM (Generalized for Pattern Printing and Logic):

Start the program.

Initialize variables for loop control (e.g., i, j, n).

Use nested loops to print patterns:

Outer loop: controls the number of rows.

Inner loop(s): controls the content of each row (stars, spaces, characters).

For logical tasks (e.g., even numbers):

Loop through the range.

Use if (i % 2 == 0) to check even numbers.

Print numbers accordingly.

End the program.

CONCLUSION: Through these C++ programs, we explored the core concepts of iterative programming, conditional execution, and console output formatting. Pattern printing enhances logical thinking and helps in mastering nested loops. These basic exercises lay the foundation for more complex algorithmic problem-solving in programming.
